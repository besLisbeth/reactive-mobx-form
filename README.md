# reactive-mobx-form
Forms library for React+MobX application. Under the hood it uses efficient MobX observable mechanizm, that allows tracking changes in form fields and rerender only things that have changed. This makes developer a feeling of working with 2-way databinding and reduces much boilerplate code needed to handle input events in 1-way data flow environment. 

The library is inspired by [Angular Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) and [Redux Form](http://redux-form.com). It has simalar syntax to Redux Form, because of concept that are neutural to React world. So if you previously had experience with it, it will be easy for you to start using `reactive-mobx-form`. But still one of the goals of this library is to be simple in usage for everyone.

## Important notice
Library is on its initial development stage, is unstable and may contain bugs. Most of all API will change.

If considering a software development as next steps:
1. Make it work <-- we are here
2. Make it right
3. Make it fast

## Motivation
Â Working with forms was always a pain in web development. This library is an attempt to solve it for MobX and React users.
 
 Goals:
 1. Minimal configuration
 2. Easy to learn and start with
 3. Preferable over own solutions(I hope it to be)

 ## Capabilities
 Its now possible: 
 1. Render simple one level forms
 2. Validate fields, see **validatorjs** docs
 3. Render multi-level fields with `ControlSection` Component
 4. Submit a form
 
 ## Dependancy
 reactive-mobx-forms depends directly on [validatorjs](https://github.com/skaterdav85/validatorjs) library. It is small, effective and scalable. 
 
 reactive-mobx-forms peer dependencies are **mobx** and **mobx-react**

 ## Know Issues
 1. There is a problem when using [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact). For some reason, if inside of componentWillMount any state change is executed(form.refisterField => changes form.values => changes form.validation => changes form.errors, that are observed by Control Component), all lifecicle methods of Component are executed twice. Which then tries to register filed twice. Possible ways of solving can be:
    1. Register field in componentDidMount 
    2. Get rid of componentWillMount and do stuff in constructor
 This requires more investigation....
 
 ## Installation
 
 ```
 npm install reactive-mobx-form --save
 ```
 
## Usage

### Step 1
Create and expose to all your application a `formStore` via [Provider](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react#provider-and-inject) from `mobx-react`

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'mobx-react';
import { FormStore } from 'reactive-mobx-form';

const formStore = new FormStore();

render(
  <Provider appStore={appStore} formStore={formStore}> //appStore - is any other store in your application
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Step 2
Create a form

```javascript
import {reactivMobxForm, Control} from 'reactive-mobx-form';

class ContactForm extends Component {
  render() {
    const { submit } = this.props;
    
    return (
      <form onSubmit={submit}>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
          <Control name="name" component="input" type="text" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="age">Age</label>
          <Control name="age" component="input" type="number"/>
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

const ContactFormReactive = reactiveMobxForm('contacts', schema)(ContactForm); // 2nd parameter (schema) is optional. 

// Use 2nd parameter to specify predefined initial values and validation rules, see format below.
// If you get initial values from server, better pass them as 'schema' paramter to Form in parent component

export default ContactFormReactive;
```

### Step 3
Use your form and enjoy

```javascript
import ContactForm from './ContactForm';

export default Page extends Component {
  handleSubmit(form) {
    console.log(form)
  }

  render() {
    <div>
      <ContactForm onSubmit={this.handleSubmit.bind(this)} /> // schema={{fieldName: [initialValue, rules]}} optional parameter
    </div>
  }
}
```

### formSchema
`formSchema` is an object with a configuration for form fields, allowing to specify their initialValues and validation rules.

Syntax is next:

Wihtout validation:
`{firstName: 'Vikor'}` is same as `{firstName: ['Viktor']}` and same as `{firstName: ['Viktor', '']}` 

With validation:
`{firstName: ['Viktor', 'required|string']}` uses **validatorjs** syntax.
